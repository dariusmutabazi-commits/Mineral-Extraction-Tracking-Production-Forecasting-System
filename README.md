## Project Overview
This PL/SQL project provides an automated solution for recording mineral extraction events, generating daily production summaries, detecting anomalies, and forecasting the next 7 days of output. The system improves accuracy, reduces manual work, and enhances decision-making for mining operations.

## Problem Statement
Most mining operations still rely on manual logs or spreadsheets to track extraction activities. This leads to:
- Inaccurate or incomplete data  
- Delayed reporting  
- Limited visibility into performance  
- No reliable forecasting  

A centralized PL/SQL system is needed to improve data quality and support production planning.

## Key Objectives
- Record extraction activities with equipment, crew, mineral type, and quantity  
- Generate daily production summaries for each mining site  
- Produce 7-day forecasts using recent historical data  
- Detect abnormal extraction patterns  
- Support BI dashboards and decision-making  

## Quick Start Instructions
1. I created Oracle user & roles .  
2. I created **`database/schema.sql`** to create all tables and sequences.  
3. I created **`database/packages.sql`** to install PL/SQL logic.  
4. I created **`database/triggers.sql`** to activate validation and audit triggers.  
5. I inserted samples data using **`database/data_samples.sql`**.  
6. I ran reporting queries from **`queries/analytics_queries.sql`**.  
7. Open **`presentation/`** to access project PowerPoint slides.
